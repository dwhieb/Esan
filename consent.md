Sunny Akhigbe gave verbal consent to participate in linguistic data gathering. He was presented with the option of signing a consent form, as well as recording consent verbally, but rather adamantly objected to both, explaining that this was a very 'white' and 'western' thing to do. It seemed to me, based on his further explanation, that he viewed a formal document or recording as a sign of distrust, and contrary to the aim of forming a working relationship together. Sunny also refused payment for similar reasons. This response wasn't entirely unexpected, as I have encountered similar responses in other parts of Africa.

I did however explain all the parts of the consent form to Sunny informally. Sunny gave permission for his data to be used freely for research, publication, archiving, and other uses, and was made aware that he could choose to keep any of his data private for any reason, and could stop participating at any time. Sunny specifically mentioned that he understands the nature of archives, because he participated in a government project to record stories of immigrants to the U.S. that had undergone hardships, and his story was archived. Sunny also gave permission for his real name to be associated with his data.

Although Sunny refused payment for working as a consultant, I know that a certain amount of reciprocity is expected, and so I offered to help Sunny record and transcribe his book, _A boy and his dream_ in Esan. He was extremely happy with this idea, and this project would greatly benefit him personally in that regard. He also suggested, independently of me saying anything in this vein, that he would like to put up an online dictionary of the language for his people. So in producing a dictionary I would be helping him with that goal as well.

Whenever possible, I will continue to consult Sunny on any uses of his data, before making that data public or incorporating it into my research.
